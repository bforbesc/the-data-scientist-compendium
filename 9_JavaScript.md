# JavaScript

- Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called *first class functions*. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.
- The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called *higher order functions*.
- When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a *lambda*.
