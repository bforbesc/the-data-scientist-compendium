# [![My Skills](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=r)](https://skills.thijs.gg)

In this section I compile the books, courses, resources, packages and anything interesting and useful (for practical application and learning) on R language. I leave out the materials on [Econometrics](https://github.com/bforbesc/the-data-scientist-compendium/blob/main/econometrics.md), which you can find on the respective section in this repository.
