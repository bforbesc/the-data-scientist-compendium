# JavaScript

- Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called *first class functions*. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.
- The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called *higher order functions*.
- When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a *lambda*.
- An *imperative style* in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.
- *Functional programming* is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.
- ´´´JavaScript´´´ offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.
