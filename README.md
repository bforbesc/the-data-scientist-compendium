# The Data Scientist Compendium
I hands-on compendium of everything (I have came across) data science. I started collecting these resources and snippets as a necessity for my day-to-day work, namely for teaching, and I thought I would share them with you! Because I work mostly on Pyhton you will see that there is an oversampling on resources on that programming language.
