In this section I gather the relevant books and general resources on Econometrics, using either R or STATA, which I found relevant in my work or learning journey.

## ðŸ“– books
- [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html)
- [R Companion to Real Econometrics](https://bookdown.org/carillitony/bailey/)

## ```STATA```
General guides to using STATA useful for both begginer and advanced users:
- [STATA tutorials](https://errickson.net/workshops.html)
